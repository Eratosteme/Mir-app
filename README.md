# Blobee Scan App

The Blobee Scan App is a mobile application designed to simplify the design and estimation of irrigation systems for crop fields. The app uses image recognition technology and cost estimation capabilities to identify the venous network of a model irrigation system and calculate the total length of water pipes.
Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3.x
    OpenCV (cv2)
    Kivy

You can install the dependencies using pip:

pip install opencv-python
pip install kivy

# Getting Started

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Navigate to the project directory.

# Usage

To run the Blobee Scan App, execute the following command:

css

python main.py

Once the app is running, you will see a window with a "Capture" button. Press the button to capture a frame from the webcam. The captured frame will be processed using the implemented image recognition logic (placeholder code), and the processed frame will be displayed in the app's image widget.
Customization

To customize the image recognition and calculation logic, modify the process_image method in the BlobeeScanApp class. Replace the placeholder code with your own image processing algorithms.
